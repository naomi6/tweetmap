Tweet Map

A web application to learn Ruby on Rails.

Using your browser's location, shows the latest tweets that contained a particular word in a 10 mile radius around you. Initially looks for "rails" but can look for anything.

To look at tweets from a different location, change the GPS coordinates in the URL.
